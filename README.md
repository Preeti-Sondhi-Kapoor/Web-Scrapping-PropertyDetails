Web Scraping Project
This repo contains my web scraping project to extract property data for a rent from a website.
For beginners, web scraping is a term used to describe the use of a program or algorithm to extract and process large amounts of data from
the web,which further can be used to analyze large amounts of datasets, the ability to scrape data from the web is a useful skill to have.

Beautiful Soup
This project uses Python, urllib and Beautiful Soup. The urllib.request module is used to open URLs. 
The Beautiful Soup is a Python library for extracting data out of HTML and XML files. We can use the Beautiful Soup library 
to parse document, and extract the text from tags.

CSV Output
In this project, we save the extracted data into a Comma-separated values (CSV) file. It is a delimited text file that uses a comma 
to separate values. After that, we can use Python Pandas library to load and analyze the data.

CAUTION
As a word of CAUTION, web scraping sometimes breaks a company terms of use, and could get you in trouble with the law, 
thus you should be careful about which sites you scrape. This repo mainly serves as my personal portfolio and for educational 
purpose for others who are interested in web scraping.
